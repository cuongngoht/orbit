# Changelog

## 0.0.1

Orbit's first open-source release, under the MIT License ([LICENSE](LICENSE)): plugin `orbit`, skills `orbit-*`, CLI `orbit`, store `~/.orbit`, configuration `ORBIT_*`. Repository: [cuongngoht/orbit](https://github.com/cuongngoht/orbit).

- Goal orchestration (`orbit`, `src/goal/`, API `orbit.goal/v1`).
- Orbit Help (`orbit-help`) for navigation and bounded coordination.
- Direct extension API `orbit.extension/v2` and capability API `orbit.capability/v1`.
- Fresh-install-only layout 3 storage, MCP state schema 3 and automation settings schema 3.
- Unsupported state and contracts are refused unchanged; no automatic conversion or aliases.
- Orbit Live's terminal look (ADR 0027): a palette at 256 or 24-bit colour with bands (none on a light background), tabs under the header, an orbit that circles only while the task moves, and `ORBITING` as the moving state's word. The starship lane and `pane.starship` are gone.
- `/orbit` opens Orbit Live as `/orbit-help` does.
